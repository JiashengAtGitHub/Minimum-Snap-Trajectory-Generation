# Minimum-Snap-Trajectory-Generation
* This work is an attempt that imitates [Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors.pdf](https://github.com/JiashengAtGitHub/Minimum-Snap-Trajectory-Generation/files/7230819/2011.-.cited.1050.-.Minimum.snap.trajectorygeneration.and.control.for.quadrotors.pdf) with my personal modification. 
* I only leave the information which I think is worth record. This README file does not include enough information for a completed wrap-up, but now I'm too busy to add more. I  apologize.:sweat_smile:
* The MATLAB code is integrated, however.
